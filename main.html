                    The IITs have consistently performed as institutions of world-class excellence in an otherwise
                    mediocre higher educational system. IIT products have fared brilliantly in advanced sectors of the
                    global economy, but has India benefited anywhere near enough? An issues focus and a look at the
                    future.
                    JAWAHARLAL NEHRU could not have imagined that the `golden jubilee' of India's finest academic
                    institution, the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), which he was instrumental in founding, would
                    be celebrated in the Silicon Valley. Through the IITs, India's first Prime Minister had hoped to
                    create a highly educated technological force that would provide vital inputs for the massive dams,
                    power plants and industrial ventures he wanted to build. It would help ensure that the country was
                    self-reliant in the realm of science and technology. Nehru could not also have anticipated the
                    tremendous global reach that `brand IIT' has come to acquire.<br>

                <span>Lovely Professional University (LPU) has emerged as a leader in the field of education. It is a
                    distinctive institution which is not less than an IIT in terms of teaching, learning, research,
                    entrepreneurship and leadership. In addition to imparting knowledge & critical thinking, the
                    university enables its students to become architects of the future society. Not just engineering,
                    the university is also known for programmes like MBA, Business Management, Design, Hotel Management,
                    Law, Pharmacy among others. LPU takes pride in its students' excellent placement record.
                    On the above lines, Tanya Arora, a promising third-year B.Tech Computer Science and Engineering
                    student at the university bagged a job with Microsoft in 2019, at a salary of Rs 42 lacs. This is
                    the biggest offer rolled out to a fresh engineering student across India in 2019. LPU has set
                    record-breaking placements continuously for the past three years and has now added another feather
                    in its placement record in the region with Taniyaâ€™s illustrious achievement.
