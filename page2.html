                    New Delhi: Taksh Gupta, the founder of a special matrimonial platform, IIT IIM Shaadi, is now
                    receiving a backlash on the microblogging platform Twitter for not being from any of the campuses of
                    the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) or the Indian Institute of Management (IIM).
                    For the unversity IIM Shaadi, as the name suggests, is a matrimonial platform that only allows
                    individuals who passed out of IIT, IIM, and other reputed institutions to register on the site.
                    According to the official website, IIT IIM Shaadi “invites registration from alumni of top few
                    Indian and Global Institutions (Management, Engineering, Architecture, Medicine, Mass Communication,
                    CA/CS/ICWA/CFA, Fashion Design & many more).”
                    The matrimonial platform has a tagline - Alma Mater Matters. Also, it appears on the website that
                    filmmaker Karan Johar is the brand sponsor of the platform. The website was started almost eight
                    years ago in 2014, and now has members in India and 50 other countries.
