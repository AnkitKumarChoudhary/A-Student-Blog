                        Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi to fully start physical classes from January onwards. The institution will follow all COVID-19-realted precautions.
                        “By November, we will have the first-year students attending in-person classes, and by January 2022, we are expecting to go back to the normal mode of teaching, of course following all the precautions,” IIT Delhi Director V Rampgopal Rao said at a press conference recently.
                        Speaking in this context, Shantanu Roy, Dean Academics, IIT Delhi, said “Over a period of time, if things remain well, we expect the DDMA (Delhi Disaster Management Authority) order to offer further relaxations.”
                        “We will then start moving to actual classrooms. Not all courses will go offline immediately. Core courses in different disciplines will go offline first and the elective courses will be continued online,” he said.
